        <h2>About me!</h2>

        <p>I started playing the piano when I was very young‚Äîso young I barely remember a time without it. I still remember the first time I climbed onto the bench at my grandmother‚Äôs piano. I didn‚Äôt know what I was doing, but I was drawn to the sound, the feel of the keys, the way the notes seemed to tell a story.

          From the beginning, it became my favorite thing to do.

          <strong> Where It All Began </strong>

          While most kids were watching cartoons or playing outside after school, I was at the piano. I‚Äôd try to play along with music I heard in movies, on the radio, or wherever I could find it. Eventually, my parents signed me up for lessons, and that‚Äôs when everything really changed.

          Playing piano wasn‚Äôt just a hobby anymore. It became something deeper‚Äîa way to express myself, especially when I couldn‚Äôt find the right words.

          <strong>The Ups and Downs </strong>

          It hasn‚Äôt always been easy. As I got older, the music became more complicated. I had to work harder, spend more time practicing, and push through moments of frustration. There were days I wanted to walk away from it all‚Äîbut I never could.

          Because every time I sit down and play, it feels like I‚Äôm exactly where I‚Äôm supposed to be.

          Over the years, I‚Äôve learned pieces by Mozart, Chopin, Beethoven‚Äîcomposers who have each taught me something different. Mozart taught me precision and elegance. Chopin showed me emotion and expression. Beethoven pushed me to be bold and powerful.

          <strong>More Than Just Notes </strong>

          For me, the piano is more than just an instrument. It‚Äôs been a place of comfort, joy, and even healing. Whether I‚Äôm happy, overwhelmed, or lost in thought, the piano is always there‚Äîwaiting.

          I‚Äôve performed in recitals, shared music with friends and family, and even started writing a little of my own. Every piece I play feels like a reflection of who I am at that moment.

          <strong>Looking Ahead </strong>

          Now, music is a huge part of my life. I‚Äôm still learning, still growing, and still falling in love with the piano every day. One of my biggest dreams is to one day help others find the same connection I did‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs through teaching, performing, or simply sharing my passion.

          The piano has shaped who I am.
          <strong>And I honestly can‚Äôt imagine life without it.</strong>

      	  <p>The piano, invented around 1700 by Italian instrument maker Bartolomeo Cristofori, evolved from earlier keyboard instruments like the harpsichord and clavichord. Cristofori‚Äôs key innovation was a hammer mechanism that allowed players to control volume with their touch‚Äîsomething previous instruments couldn‚Äôt do. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the piano's design improved with expanded range, stronger frames, and better mechanics, making it a favorite among composers like Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin. It also became a fixture in middle-class homes as a symbol of culture and entertainment. In the 20th century, the piano thrived in new genres like jazz, blues, and pop, with artists like Duke Ellington, Ray Charles, and Elton John redefining its role in music. Technology introduced electric and digital pianos, expanding access and versatility. Today, the piano remains central to music-making‚Äîvalued for its wide range, expressive power, and ability to blend melody, harmony, and rhythm in a single instrument.</p>

                <strong>He went deaf: One of the most remarkable facts about Beethoven is that he began losing his hearing in his late 20s and was almost completely deaf by his 40s‚Äîyet he continued composing some of his greatest music after that.

				He had a fiery temper: Beethoven was known for being intense, stubborn, and sometimes difficult, but also deeply emotional and idealistic.

				He never married: Though he fell in love several times, Beethoven never married, and his mysterious letters to an unnamed ‚ÄúImmortal Beloved‚Äù are still a subject of curiosity.

				He was a bridge between eras: Beethoven‚Äôs music marks the transition from the Classical style (like Mozart and Haydn) to the more emotional and expressive Romantic era Here are a few of Beethoven‚Äôs masterpieces that are widely celebrated:

				Symphony No. 5 in C Minor

				üé∂ Famous for its iconic 4-note opening: ‚Äúda-da-da-DUM!‚Äù

				A symbol of triumph over adversity.

				Symphony No. 9 in D Minor ("Choral")

				üó£Ô∏è Includes ‚ÄúOde to Joy‚Äù, a powerful choral finale.

				Often considered one of the greatest pieces of music ever written.
				Moonlight sonata (14 moovment)

				üåô Dreamy, haunting, and deeply emotional.

				A favorite for pianists and listeners alike.</strong>
