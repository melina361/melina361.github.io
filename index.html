				<h2>About me!</h2>
				
				<p>I started playing the piano when I was very youngâ€”so young I barely remember a time without it. I still remember the first time I climbed onto the bench at my grandmotherâ€™s piano. I didnâ€™t know what I was doing, but I was drawn to the sound, the feel of the keys, the way the notes seemed to tell a story.

From the beginning, it became my favorite thing to do.

<strong> Where It All Began </strong>

While most kids were watching cartoons or playing outside after school, I was at the piano. Iâ€™d try to play along with music I heard in movies, on the radio, or wherever I could find it. Eventually, my parents signed me up for lessons, and thatâ€™s when everything really changed.

Playing piano wasnâ€™t just a hobby anymore. It became something deeperâ€”a way to express myself, especially when I couldnâ€™t find the right words.

<strong>The Ups and Downs </strong>

It hasnâ€™t always been easy. As I got older, the music became more complicated. I had to work harder, spend more time practicing, and push through moments of frustration. There were days I wanted to walk away from it allâ€”but I never could.

Because every time I sit down and play, it feels like Iâ€™m exactly where Iâ€™m supposed to be.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve learned pieces by Mozart, Chopin, Beethovenâ€”composers who have each taught me something different. Mozart taught me precision and elegance. Chopin showed me emotion and expression. Beethoven pushed me to be bold and powerful.

<strong>More Than Just Notes </strong>

For me, the piano is more than just an instrument. Itâ€™s been a place of comfort, joy, and even healing. Whether Iâ€™m happy, overwhelmed, or lost in thought, the piano is always thereâ€”waiting.

Iâ€™ve performed in recitals, shared music with friends and family, and even started writing a little of my own. Every piece I play feels like a reflection of who I am at that moment.

<strong>Looking Ahead </strong>

Now, music is a huge part of my life. Iâ€™m still learning, still growing, and still falling in love with the piano every day. One of my biggest dreams is to one day help others find the same connection I didâ€”whether thatâ€™s through teaching, performing, or simply sharing my passion.

The piano has shaped who I am.
<strong>And I honestly canâ€™t imagine life without it.</strong> </p>
